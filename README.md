# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms-Project
This project simulates three popular disk scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
The program allows users to input a sequence of disk requests along with the initial head position, then computes and compares the order of service, total head movement, and average seek time based on the selected algorithm.

🔍 Algorithms Overview
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Services requests in the exact order of arrival.
Simple but can result in high total head movement.
2. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
Selects the request closest to the current head position.
Optimizes seek time but may cause starvation for distant requests.
3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
Moves the disk head in one direction (like an elevator), servicing all requests in its path until the end is reached.
Then, the direction reverses and continues servicing.
📥 Input Format
The user needs to provide:

A list of disk track requests (integers)
The initial head position
The choice of scheduling algorithm (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN)
(For SCAN) The direction of head movement: "left" or "right"
